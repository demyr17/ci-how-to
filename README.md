how to blog page for CodeIgniter

Our documentation receives some criticism and I offered a "how to" page besides/supporting our documentation under one of the threads. So that we would have a richer content like other projects have on internet.
Here you will find my suggestion layout.
If they are OK for you, I will start a new topic on the forum for the operation.
